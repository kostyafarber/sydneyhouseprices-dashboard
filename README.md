# Description

A small project that visualises the median selling prices of Sydney properties in a choropleth map using Plotly. The data used for this project was found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mihirhalai/sydney-house-prices/activity>) on Kaggle.

I encourage you to use the binder link so you can actually play around with the code instead of just seeing a HTML page. It takes quite a long while to load so hang in there if you'd like to interact with the code!

# Motivation

Choropleth maps are a beautiful way to visualise geospatial statistical data. I stumbled upon them in a medium blog and wanted to implement my own using Python. I found there was sparse documentation on how to plot such graphs using geospatial data for Australia. I found it tricky to get this working but eventually I got it and the results looked great. Hopefully the code here may help others (a blog post is on the way to describe the code).

I also wanted to learn git and github, so another aspect to this project was to post it here and conduct version control. Also being a part of an open source community is important to me, so working my way around Binder, to make my code available and executable to play around with was another motivation in posting this project here and motivating me to learn these tools to share whatever I can with the world, even if its something small.
