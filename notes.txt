Notes for this project.

- Setting up plotly in juptyterlab is harder than expected. Additional installs and extensions are needed to run, or
render the graphs.

- Checking if I can use geopandas dataframes instead of having to convert to geojson and back etc.

- Set up using this command:
   jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly
